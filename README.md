Spark streaming with random numbers

The "server_random_generator.py" will create a TCP IP server will send random number if a client will connect to the server. 
You can test is with the "client_random_generator.py" 

You can also process the data with Spark streaming see the "spark.ipynb". In the example I used anaconda3 framework. I started a Jupyter-notebook which can import the pyspark modules.
